  let us begin with a quick introduction in C.Our aim is to show the elements fo the language in real programs,but without getting
bogged down in details,rules,and exceptions.At this point,we are not tying to be complete or even precise(save that the examples 
are meant to be corret).We want to get you as quickly as possible to the point where you can wrirte useful programs,and to do that
we have to concentrate on the basics:variables and constants,arithmetic,control flow,function,and the rudiments of input and out 
put.We are interntionally leaving out of this chapter features of C that are important for writing bigger programs.These include 
pointers,structures,most of C's rich ser of opeators,several aontrol-flow statments,and the standard library.

  This approach and its drawbacks.Most notable is that complete story on any pariocular feature is not found here,and the 
tutorial,bu being bref,may also be misleading.And because the examples do noe use the full power of C,they are not as concise and 
elegant as they might be.We have tried to minimize thesr effects,but be warned.Another drawback is that later chapters will 
neccssarily repeat some of this chapter.We hope that the repetition will help you more than in annoys.

  In any case,experienced programmers should be able to extrapolate from the meterial in this chapter to their own programming 
needs.Beginners should supplement it by writing small,similar programs of their own.Both groups can use it as a framework on which
to hang the more detailed descriprions thet begin in Chapter2.
