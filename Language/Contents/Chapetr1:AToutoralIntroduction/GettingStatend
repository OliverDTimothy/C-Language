  The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.The first program to write is the same for all 
language:
  	
	Print the words
 	hello,world

  This is a big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere,compile it successfully,load 
it,run it,and find out where your output went.With  these mecanical details mastered,everthing else is comparatively easy.

  In C,the program to print "hello,world"is

#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
	printf("hello,world\n");
}
 
 Just how to run this program depends on the system you are using.As a specific example,on the UNIX operating system you must 
create the peogram in a file whose name ends in ".c",such as hello.c,then compile it with the command
	
	cc hello.c
  
  If you haven't botched anything,such as omitting a character or misspelling something,the compilation will proceed silently,and 
make an excutable file called a.out.If you run a.out by typing the command
  	
	a.out
 
  it will print
  	
	hello,world
  
  On other systems,the rules will be different;check with a local expert.
  
  Now,for some explanations about the program itself.A C program,whatever its sizem consists of functions and variables.A function
contains statements that specify the computing operations to be done,and variables store values used during the computation.C 
functions ate like the subroutines and functions in Fortan or the procedures and functions of Pascal.Our example is function 
named main.Normally you are at liberty to give functions whatever names you like,but"main"is specoal-your program begins 
executing at the beginning of main.This means that every program must have a main somewhere.

  main will usually call other functions to help perforn its jop,some that you wrote,and others from libraries that are provided 
for you.The first line of the program,
  	
	#include <stdio.h>
       
  tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library;the line appears at the beginning of many C 
source files.The standard library is deceribed in Chapter 7 and Appendix B.

  One method of communicating data between functions is for the calling function to provide a list of values,callde arguments,to 
the function it calls.The parentheses after the function name surround the argument list.In this example,main is definde to be a 
function that expects no arguments,which is indicated by the empty list().
 
#include <stdio.h>		include information about standard library
main()					defin a fuction called main
					that received no argument values
{				statements of main are enclosed in braces
	printf("hello,world\n");	main calls library function printf
}				to print this sequenece of characters
				\n represents the newline character

  The statements of a function are enalose in braces { }.The function main contains only one statment.

  	printf("hello,world\n");

  A function is called by naming it,followed by a parnthesized list of arguments,so this calls the function pritnf with the 
argument "hello,world\n".pritf is a library function that prints ouput, in this case the string of characters between the quotes.

  A sequence of characrers in double quptes,like"hello,,world\n",is called a character string ot string constant.For the moment 
our only ues of character strings will be as arguments for pritnf and other functions.

  The sequence \n in the string is C notation for the newline character,which when prined advasnces the output to the left margin 
on the next line.If you leave out the \n (a worthwhile experoment),you will find that there is no line advance after the output is
printed.You must use \n to include a newline chatacter in the printf argument;if you try something like

  	printf("hello,world
	");

  the C compiler will produce an error message.

  Notice that \n represents only a single a newline charater aoutmatically,so seveal calls may be used to build up an output line 
in stages.Out first program could coulf just as well been written

#include <stido.h>

main()
{
	printf("hello,");
	printf("world");
	printf("\n");
}

  to profuce identical output.

  Notice thet \n represents only a single character.An escape sequence lile \n provides a general and extensible mechanism for 
reprseenting hard-to-type or incisible characters.Among the others that C provides are \t for tab, \b for backspcace, \"for the 
doubel quote and \\ for the backslash itelf.Theres is a complete list in Section2.3.

  Excricse 1-1.Run the "hello,world"program on your system.Experiment with leaving out parts of the program,to see what error 
messages you get.

  Exercise 1-2.Experiment to find out what happens when prints's argument sting contains \c,where c is some charcater not listed 
above.
