  C is a genral-purpose programming language.It has been closely associated with the UNIX operating system where it was developed,
since both the system and most of the programs that run on it are written in C.The language,however,is not tied to any one 
operating system or machine;and although it has been callde a "system programming langugage"because it is useful for writing 
compolers and operating system,it has been used equally well to write major programs in many differen domains.
  
  Many of the important ideas of C stem from the language BCPL,developed by Martin Richards.The influence of BCPL on C proceeded 
indirectly through the language B,which was written by Ken Thompson in 1970 for the first UNIX system on the DEC PDP-7.
  
  BCPL and B are "typeless"language.By contrast,C provides a variety of data types.The fundamental types characters,and integers 
and floating point numbers of several sizes.In addition,there is a hierarchy of derived data types created with pointers,arrays,
structures and unions.Expressions are formed from operators and operands;any expression,including an assignment or a function 
call,can be a statement.Pointers provide for machine-independent address arithmetic.

  C provides the fundemmental control-flow constructions required for well-stryctured programs:statement grouping,decision 
making(if-else),selecting one of a set of possible values(switch),looping with the termination test the top(while, for)or at the 
bottom (do),and early loop exit(break).

  Functions may return values of basic types,structures,unios,or pointers.Any function may be called recursively.Local variables 
are typically"automatic",or created anew with each invocarion.Function definitions may not be nested but variables may be 
declared in a block-structured fashion.The functions of a C program may exist in separate source files that are compiled 
separately.Vaiables may be internal to a function,extenal but known only within a single source file,or cisible to the entire 
program.

  A preprocessing step performs macro substitution on program text,inclusion of other source files,and conditional compilation.

  C is a relatively "low-level"language.This characteization is not pejorative;it simply means that C deals with the same sort of 
objects that most computers do,namely characters,numbers,and addtesses.These may be combined and moved about with the arithmetisc 
and logical operations implemented by real manchines.

  C provides no operation to deal directly with composite objects such as chareacter strings,sets.lists or arrays.There are no 
operations that manipulate an entire array or string,although structures may be copied as a unit.The language does not define any 
storage allocation facility othen than static definition and the stack discipline provided by the local variables of functions;
there are no READ or WRITE starements,and no built-in file access methods.All of these higher-level mechanisms must be provided 
by explictily called functions.Most C implementations have included a reasonbly standard collection of such functions.

  Similarly,C offers only straighforward,single-thread control flow:tests,loops,grouping,and subprograms,but not multiprogramming,
parallel operations,synchronization,or coroutines.
