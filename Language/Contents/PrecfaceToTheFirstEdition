  C is a general-purpose programming language with features economy of expression,modern flow control and data structrues,and 
a rich set of openators,C is not'a "very high level"language,nor a "big"one,and is not specialized to any particular area of 
application.But its absence of restrictions and its generality make it more convenient and effective for many tasks than 
supposedly more powerful language.

  C was originally designed for and implemented on the UNIX operating system on the DECPDP-11,by Dennis Ritchie.The operating 
syste,the C compiler,and essentially all UNIX applications programs(incluuding all of the software used to prepare this book)
are written in C.Production compilers also exist for several other machines,including the IBM System/370,the Hoeywell6000,and the 
Interdata8/32.C is not tied to any particular hardware or system,however,and it is easy to write programs that will run withourt 
change on any machine that supports C.

  This book is meant to help the reder learn how to program in C.It contains a tutorial introduction to get new users stated as 
soon as possible,separate chapters on each major feature,and a reference maunal.Most of the treatment is based on reading,witing 
and revising examples,rather that on mere statments of rules.For the most part,the examples are complete,real programs rether 
than isolated frgments.All examples have to make effective use of the languagge,we have also tried where possible to illustrate 
useful algorithms and principles of good style and sound design.

  The book is not an introductory programming manual;it assumes some familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables,
assignment statments,loops,and functions.Nonetheless,a novice programmer should be able to read along and pick up the language,
although access to more knowledageable colleague will help.

  In our expeoence,C has proven to be a pleasant,expressive and versatile language for a wide varety of programs,It is easy to 
learn,and it wears well an on's experience with it grows.We hope that this book will help you to use it well.

  The thoughtful criricisms and suggestions of many friends and colleagues have added greatly to this book and to our pleasure in 
writing it.In particular,Mike Bianchi,Jim Blue,Sru Feldman,Doug Mcilroy Bill Roome,Bob Rosin and larry Rosler all read multiple 
volumes with care,We are also indebted to Al Aho, Steve Bourne,Dan Dvorak,Chuck Haley,Debbie Haley,Marion Harris,Rick Holt,Steve 
Johnson,John Mashey,Bob Mitze,Ralph Muha,Peter Nelson,Elliot Pinson,Bill Planger,Jerry Spivack,Ken Thompson,and Peter Weinberger 
for helpful comments at various stages,and to Mile Lesk and Joe Ossanna for invaluable assistance with typesetting.
